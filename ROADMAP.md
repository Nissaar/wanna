Road map
====

**Disclaimer: This is not a mission statement. We don't guarantee to develop Wanna exactly based on this roadmap. This file is subject to change in the future, and some new features could be added, or existing ones may be updated, postponed or even totally dropped.**

Wanna is growing, and a lot of features are out there to be added to it. So we have to prioritize them and work on the most important parts first. Here comes the road map of Wanna.

Wanna Flex Beta
----
The next version of the app, Flex Beta, will be focused on testing, performance, animations (and flexibility, for sure!):
1. **Testing:** Wanna Flex Alpha was completed without writing any line of tests. A software without tests is not a good software. So the first concern in Flex Beta version will be adding tests.
2. **Performance:** Although React is developed with performance considerations in the head, Wanna is still a bit slow. So performance improvement becomes an important case.
3. **Animations:** Let's be reckless. No matter how beautiful Wanna becomes and implement Google Material Design better, it is still ugly without animations. Just adding very basic animations will fulfill the user need for animations.
4. **Flexibility:** Wait! There is more. This version of Wanna is named **Flex**, as it aims at giving the user *flexibility* in getting his/her tasks done. This is the most important feature to be implemented (but the last one, too, as previous features are vital for the app, and should not be postponed).
