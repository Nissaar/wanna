# Contributing to Wanna

Welcome, contributor. Let's make the world of open source a better place! :rocket: :rocket:  
Wanna welcomes contributions of different types. There are a lot of work to do, and you can help us get them done.  

## Types of contribution
There are multiple kinds of contributions we seek for, ranging from effortless ones like feature suggestion, to harder ones like
app development. Below comes the list of contribution types. Please make sure you have satisfied prerequisties of each contribution type before reading its guidelines, otherwise you may do redundant work.  

### Feature requests :bulb:

* Install and use the app

Feature requests are the easiest type of contribution in Wanna. If you think a feature will make Wanna better, inform us!  
To do so, follow these steps:  
1. Search issues and see if anyone has suggested a feature like your one.
2. If nobody has suggested such a feature, open a new issue and start its title with `[Feature Request] ` (i.e. `[Feature Request] Add support for Persian language`).
3. Expalain exactly what you are looking for. Provide additional links, images, etc. if needed.

We may label your issue as `Needs-check`, or we may directly add `idea` or `new-feature` label to your issue, indicating your issue is approved.
