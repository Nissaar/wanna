#### What is different in wanna?

Wanna implements a to-do list in a different way. You don't just put a task
in your to-do list and set a due date for it. Wanna workflow differs:

1. An idea occurs to you. It can be any type of idea; listening to a music
your friends say is awesome, doing your university homework, start exercising,
reading a book, learning a new programming language, planning always to smile
and launching a small party with your family or friends are just examples.

2. You add that idea to your ideas list. There is no need to care about when
to do it, as it's just an idea, not a task.

3. Now you have a bunch of ideas. You can scroll up and down and choose one of
the ideas in your list. Or you can get random ideas to plan to work on.

4. Once you chose your idea, you convert it to some tasks. You have to set a
period of time in which each task should be done. This is one of the biggest
differences between Wanna and other to-do list apps, as in other apps you
usually set a fixed day as due date for the task, but in Wanna you set a period.
I think it can make you more flexible in getting tasks done.
In addition, you have to estimate how much time the task will take.
(Note that you can skip the previous three sections and directly add a task.)

5. Having your tasks added to your list, the app shows each task with a custom 
color. The more the color tends to become red, the closer the end of task period
is. Don't let those colors become red!
