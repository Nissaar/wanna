Road map
====

**Disclaimer: This is not a mission statement. We don't guarantee to develop Wanna exactly based on this roadmap. This file is subject to change in the future, and some new features could be added, or existing ones may be updated, postponed or even totally dropped.**

Wanna is growing, and a lot of features are out there to be added to it. So we have to prioritize them and work on the most important parts first. Here comes the road map of Wanna.

Wanna Flex Beta
----
The next version of the app, Flex Beta, will be focused on testing, performance, animations (and flexibility, for sure!):
- [X] **Testing:** Wanna Flex Alpha was completed without writing any line of tests. A software without tests is not a good software. So the first concern in Flex Beta version will be adding tests.
- [X] **Performance:** Although React is developed with performance considerations in the head, Wanna is still a bit slow. So performance improvement becomes an important case.
- [x] **Animations:** Let's be reckless. No matter how beautiful Wanna becomes and implement Google Material Design better, it is still ugly without animations. Just adding very basic animations will fulfill the user need for animations.
- [ ] **Flexibility:** Wait! There is more. This version of Wanna is named **Flex**, as it aims at giving the user *flexibility* in getting his/her tasks done. This is the most important feature to be implemented (but the last one, too, as previous features are vital for the app, and should not be postponed).

Wanna Flex
----
And then comes Wanna Flex, the first official, not pre-release of the app, with new features in mind! Syncing, Wanna PWA, and Internationalization will be the most important ones.
- [ ] **Syncing:** Syncing is truly crucial for Wanna. You add a task in your laptop, then go to your work, turn on your PC at your office and open Wanna. Ah, your new task is not in *that* Wanna. It really, really sucks. (The problem here is the need for some servers, however, and most servers are not free! This is a big bottleneck.)
- [ ] **Wanna Progressive Web App (PWA):** Writing Wanna native apps need lots of effort. Even by using `React native`, it takes a lot of time (or better, it's impossible) to implement Google Material Design for `react-native`, as `material-ui` (the library used to give the desktop app Material Design look) is not available for `react-native` at this time. In opposite, converting current desktop implementation of Wanna to a PWA requires small tweaks, and can be done faster. So there is an intention to introduce Wanna PWA in Flex version. (Like syncing, however, this feature is dependent on the availability of some servers.)
- [ ] **Internationalization:** At this time, the only language Wanna officially support is English. It will be nice to add more languages to the app, in order to satisfy a broader community of the users from all over the world.

What's next?
----
Flex is not the end. There will be a lot of other features in the next versions of the app, including:
- [ ] **AI:** Based on Wanna philosophy, AI is one the most important things to be added to the app. (It is not exactly clear how AI can be used in Wanna, but as an example, AI powered Wanna may suggest you due dates or time estimations for your tasks, helping you become more productive.)
- [ ] **Projects:** Grouping tasks into projects will help you get more organized about your work. Wanna will benefit from the projects in the future.
- [ ] **Reports:** Seeing a comprehensive report of the things you got done will make you more motivated about your work and help you identify your strengths and weaknesses in a more visual way.
- [ ] **Connect:** Getting your tasks done is more enjoyable when there is a community. In the next versions, you can get in touch with others from all over the world, collaborate or compete with them, share your achievements and more.

*Note: The above features need plenty of time and resources. Although we do our best in developing Wanna, some of the mentioned features may not become practical and may be totally dropped, as we said earlier.*
